/**
 * DATABASE SCHEMA AGGREGATOR
 *
 * Project: Governance System (ASPPIBRA DAO)
 * ORM: Drizzle ORM
 * Database: SQLite / Cloudflare D1
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * -------
 * This file is the central composition point of the Drizzle schema.
 *
 * It:
 *   - re-exports domain tables;
 *   - re-exports domain relations;
 *   - exposes schema constants;
 *   - preserves compatibility with existing consumers;
 *   - registers the complete schema surface for Drizzle Query API.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL ROLE
 * ------------------
 * This file is an AGGREGATOR.
 *
 * It is NOT:
 *   - a domain;
 *   - a business-rule layer;
 *   - a repository;
 *   - a service;
 *   - an application use case.
 *
 * DATABASE OWNERSHIP RULE
 * -----------------------
 * Each physical table belongs to exactly one persistence domain below.
 *
 * Infrastructure/application code SHOULD import tables directly from
 * their owning domain module whenever practical.
 *
 * Prefer:
 *
 *   import { users } from '@/db/user/tables';
 *
 * over:
 *
 *   import { users } from '@/db/schema';
 *
 * The schema aggregator remains valid for:
 *   - Drizzle schema composition;
 *   - Database Factory registration;
 *   - Query API registration;
 *   - compatibility with legacy consumers during migration.
 *
 * IMPORTANT
 * ---------
 * The numeric prefixes below describe documentation order only.
 * They DO NOT establish application dependency priority.
 *
 * Actual dependencies must be inferred from:
 *   1. Foreign Keys;
 *   2. Drizzle relations();
 *   3. Application-layer imports;
 *   4. Domain events;
 *   5. Explicit logical references.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH
 * ---------------
 * The table lists below represent the CURRENT PHYSICAL DATABASE SCHEMA.
 *
 * Do NOT add future/planned entities to this document until they
 * physically exist in the corresponding tables.ts file.

/**
 * ======================================================================
 * FINAL ARCHITECTURAL RULES
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * 1. One physical table has one persistence owner.
 *
 * 2. The numeric domain order is documentation order only.
 *
 * 3. A table must not be described here unless it physically exists in
 *    the current schema/<domain>/tables.ts.
 *
 * 4. Future/planned entities must not be added to this map until they
 *    actually exist in the physical schema.
 *
 * 5. Logical references must not be described as physical foreign keys.
 *
 * 6. Domain business rules do not belong in this file.
 *
 * 7. The aggregator may preserve compatibility for existing consumers,
 *    but new infrastructure code should prefer direct domain table
 *    imports.
 *
 * 8. Changes to table ownership, columns, foreign keys, indexes,
 *    constraints or relations require corresponding inventory validation.
 *
 * 9. The authoritative physical representation remains the respective
 *    tables.ts and relations.ts files plus the validated schema inventory.
 *
 * 10. This file documents the CURRENT STATE. It must never become a
 *     speculative roadmap.
